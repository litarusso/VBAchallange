# VBAchallenge

## Overview of Project

This analysis was conducted to understand the changes and stock prices. I also tried to make them visually appealing and easy to understand for Steve. For that reason I've used colorfull tables.

## Results

The results show a major negative return in the stock prices between 2018 and 2017. In the below tables, you can see the details of how the returns are negatively impacted between those two years. The first image shows the returns from 2018, and the second shows the results from 2017.

## Summary

This analysis had several steps and I've spent too much time to conduct it. Below, you can see the run times for the code.

It was hard to refactoring the code, because there were duplicates. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to use some online resources.
