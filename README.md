# VBAchallenge

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis was conducted to understand the changes and stock prices. I also made them visually appealing and easy to understand for Steve. 

### Results

#### Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The results show a major negative return in the stock prices between 2018 and 2017. In the image below you can see the details of how the returns are negatively impacted between those two years. The first image shows the returns from 2018, and the second shows the results from 2017.

### Summary
#### In a summary statement, address the following questions.

This analysis had several steps and I spent too much time to conduct it. Below, you can see the run times for the code.

It was hard to refactoring the code because there were duplicates. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to use some online resources.
